This is a simple Jekyll formatted implementation of [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com) with [Blueprint CSS](http://blueprintcss.org) (rather than the default CSS it provides).

The CSS for application.css is generated via [Less.js](http://github.com/cloudhead/less.js).  I utilize [less.app](http://incident57.com/less/) to dynamically generate any *.less files in _stylesheets and export them to the stylesheets folder.

Feel free to fork, modify, etc. as much as you desire.  I took the approach I've used many times before of creating includes to allow multiple layouts that pick / choose which portion of the site they want to display.

Enjoy!
